Matilda is not yet five years old, and already she is a very unusual child. Teaching herself to read, she works her way through all the books in the children's library and then gets started on the adult section, to the amazement of the librarian. Her narrow minded parents don't notice that they have a genius in their midst - but is soon becomes clear that underestimating Matilda is a big mistake.
When she starts school at Crunchem Hall, Matilda meets the frightening and bullying headmistress, Agatha Trunchbull, and witnesses her terrible temper. Soon, she puts her very special talents to work to get the better of Miss Trunchbull and the other unpleasant grown-ups around her - as well as to help warm-hearted class teacher Miss Honey.
This modern fairy-tale with a brilliantly inspiring young heroine is one of Roald Dahl's best loved stories. Full of magic and mischief, children will love witnessing Matilda pit her strength, courage and cool intelligence against the nasty and spiteful adults in her life, and ultimately coming out on top.
