Mrs Loisel was born into a poor family, but was endowed with great beauty. She was very ambitious. She envisioned herself as part of the highest level of French society. As she grew up, she was increasingly ashamed of her circumstances, but there was little she could do about it. Eventually, she was married to a clerk at the Ministry of Education. One day, Mr Loisel brought home an invitation to a ball, from the Minister of Education. When she looked at it, Mrs Loisel was filled with sorrow. She sobbed, “I cannot come. I don’t even have a good dress to wear,” she wailed. Soon, Mr Loisel bought her a dress with his savings. Mrs Loisel then said that the dress would look very plain without some jewelry. It was clear that her husband could not afford any. So, she went to a rich friend, Mrs Forestier, who agreed to lend her a truly splendid diamond necklace. Mrs Loisel was the prettiest woman at the ball. All the important people admired her beauty. It was nearly 4 am when they returned home. Then she made a terrible discovery, the necklace had disappeared. Their efforts to find it were in vain. It was gone, and they knew they had to buy another, to give to Mrs Forestier.
